st.markdown("""
**Rebalancing** is the process of realigning the weights of a portfolio of assets. This involves periodically buying or selling assets to maintain your original desired level of asset allocation and risk.

**Why Rebalance?**
- **Maintain Risk Profile:** Over time, some investments grow faster than others, shifting your portfolio's balance and potentially making it riskier than you intended.
- **Disciplined Investing:** Rebalancing forces you to "buy low and sell high." You trim your winners and add to your underperformers.

Below are the AI-generated recommendations to help align your portfolio with your chosen risk profile.
